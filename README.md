# Stroke_Disease_Prediction
Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide and one of the most lifethreatening diseases for persons above 65 years. It injures the brain like “heart attack” which injures the heart. Once a stroke disease occurs, it is not only cost huge medical care and permanent disability but can eventually lead to death. Every 4 minutes someone dies of stroke, but up to 80% of stroke can be prevented if we can identify or predict the occurrence of stroke in its early stage. Stroke is a blood clot or bleed in the brain which can make permanent damage that has an effect on mobility, cognition, sight or communication. Stroke is considered as medical urgent situation and can cause long-term neurological damage, complications and often death. The majority of strokes are classified as ischemic embolic and Hemorrhagic. An ischemic embolic stroke happens when a blood clot forms away from the patient brain usually in the patient heart and travels through the patient bloodstream to lodge in narrower brain arteries. Hemorrhagic stroke is considered another type of brain stroke as it happens when an artery in the brain leaks blood or ruptures. Strokes are sudden but many of the disease processes that precede them take a long time to develop. This is why age is the most clear-cut risk factor for stroke: the chance of blockage or breakage rises with every passing year, so – although it can strike at any age – stroke is much more likely the older we get. The stroke risk factors included in the profile are age, systolic blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol, diabetes, smoking status and intensity, physical activity, alcohol drinking, past history (hypertension, coronary heart disease) and family history (stroke, coronary heart disease). On the basis of the risk factors in the profile, which can be readily determined on routine physical examination in a physician's office, stroke risk can be estimated. An individual's risk can be related to the average risk of stroke for persons of the same age and sex.

# Problem Statement
Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide and remains an important health burden both for the individuals and for the national healthcare systems. Potentially modifiable risk factors for stroke include hypertension, cardiac disease, diabetes, and dysregulation of glucose metabolism, atrial fibrillation, and lifestyle factors. 

Therefore, the goal of our project is to apply principles of machine learning over large existing data sets to effectively predict the stroke based on potentially modifiable risk factors. Then it intended to develop the application to provide a personalized warning based on each user’s level of stroke risk and a lifestyle correction message about the stroke risk factors.
