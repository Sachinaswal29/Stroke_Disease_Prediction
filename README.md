# Stroke_Disease_Prediction
A stroke is caused when blood flow to a part of the brain is stopped abruptly. Without  the blood supply, the brain cells gradually die, and disability occurs depending on the area of the  brain affected.
Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide and remains an important health burden both for the individuals and for the national healthcare systems. Potentially modifiable risk factors for stroke include hypertension, cardiac disease, diabetes, and dysregulation of glucose metabolism, atrial fibrillation, and lifestyle factors. 
Therefore, the goal of our project is to apply principles of machine learning over large existing data sets to effectively predict the stroke based on potentially modifiable risk factors. Then it intended to develop the application to provide a personalized warning based on each user’s level of stroke risk and a lifestyle correction message about the stroke risk factors.
